make sure your code is not dependent on user interface
make sure code is following the single responsibilty principle(srp: one function, one functionality)
ensure their are proper exception handling in your code
ensure your function have return statements
if you cant test anything that means your logic is bad
integration and unit testing should be different
mock environment
tdd forces to develope a clean and crisp code



jasmine mocha jest are the unit testing libraries
chai is an assertion library
sinon is a mock creation library: use for mock frameworks
with the help of sinon we will create fake function



>> steps for creating unit testing in any of these libraries:
    >all the 3 libraries are having the describe statements or describe functions
    >purpose of describe-> create environment, group the unit tests
    it function->the actual unit testing happens inside the it method 
    before each method this method will allow you to set the data or mock data or mock functions
    this mock data, function can be set before execution of every unit test
